| DUMB COMPONENTS
|===============================================================================
|
| Dumb Components are encapsulated React components that are driven solely by
| props and don't talk to Redux. They should stay the same regardless of your
| router, data fetching library, etc.
|
| "Dumb" components aka "presentational" components are components that receive
| all data by props, aren't aware of Redux, and only specify the appearance but
| not the behaviour.
